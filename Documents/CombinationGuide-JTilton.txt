What's New
================================
I received a LOT of complaints immediately about the extraordinary width of the
combination tables, so I converted them into long lists.  I never thought
anybody would want to print this, since paper doesn't have any kind of "search"
function.  Lesson learned.  The text weighs in at more than a hundred printed
pages now, so make sure you know what you're doing before stabbing the PRINT
button.

================================
1.   Purpose
================================
The purpose of this document is to provide details on how pieces of armor,
shields, and blades in the Playstation game "Vagrant Story" can be combined to
make new items.

The combination results are presented in tabluar form, from which the reader
should be able to determine what kind of armor, shield or blade, as well its
material, will result from almost any combination.  Some vaguely defined rules
about combining are extracted from the tabular data.

The methodology for extracting the combination data directly from files
contained on the game disc is described briefly.  This will enable anybody with
the proper tools and skill to independently verify the combination results
presented.

The ways in which the class, affinity, and other attack/defense stats of armor,
blades, and shields are affected by combination are not covered here.

Plot details and play tips are not within the intended scope of this document.
There are no spoilers.  Resources such as the game's own manual, the extensive
in-game help, and other FAQs cover those items well enough that repeating them
here is not useful.

================================
2.   Lengthy Introduction
================================
I suppose it's possible to play through Vagrant Story without ever changing
clothes, but it wouldn't be easy.  If you want to take on Asura in the same
sandals and jerkin you started with, I'm not going to stop you, but you're
missing out on one of the biggest features of the game.

Armor, shields, and blades are scattered throughout the game in chests, and they
are also often dropped by enemies once slain.  Some of this will be better than
what you already own, but much of it will not.  All of it is potentially useful
in the workshops, where it can be combined and reforged into stronger stuff.
Even better, you get to keep it all from one play-through to the next, so you
can keep upgrading your equipment for as long as the game holds your attention.

The downside is that you start accumulating a LOT of it.  More than you can
keep, in fact.  You have to make some hard and poorly informed decisions about
what to do with it.  Combining two pieces into one saves some space, but how can
you know which to combine?  And would the results be any better than just
throwing some of it away?

During play one day, I dished out an atomic dopeslap on Asura, and she dropped
Marlene's Ring, which gives +25 on all classes and affinities.  This one
accessory let me ditch all those other single-use accessories in my box, freeing
up much more room for armor.  I made a personal goofy sub-quest of of acquiring
one of each piece of armor.  I got most of it, but some items like a jerkin or
hauberk were elusive.  I looked for ways to create these items from spares.

I took out what items I had and took notes on how they all combined together.  I
didn't use any strategy guide except for the brief list of singular advantageous
combinations in Zy Nicholson's walkthrough.  (Great text, btw.  Entertaining as
well as informative.)  I personally performed each armor combination.  I made
lots of mistakes.

I had most of the armor combinations down. I got started on the shields, but I
was dreading working on all the possible blade combinations.  It was just too
much to do by hand[note 1].  I had to find a better way.

One day, I had the disc in my PC looking for movies and sounds and stuff, and I
stumbled through the \MENU directory, where there are four suspiciously named
files. ITEMNAME.BIN, ARMOR.SYD, BLADE.SYD, and SHIELD.SYD.  A peek at the data
structures told me this was all the information I was looking for.  I exctracted
the pertinent data and compared it to my own empirical results to figure out how
it was organized.  Once set out straight, I found many discrepancies between my
own results and those given by the file.  A quick double-check by playing the
game showed that the data extracted from the files was more accurate than what I
had recorded previously.  As Archimedes put it, Eureka!  I decided to put it all
into a single text file so that nobody else will have to wear out their thumbs
doing it the hard way.

[note 1]Actually, I wasn't doing all of it by hand.  I had doctored up a third-
rate controller so it could be connected to a PC, where a silly little prog
would do all the menu-piloting for me.  All I had to do was sit back and take
notes.  Like I always say, it takes a lot of work to be lazy.

================================
3.   Notes on the Text
================================
3.1. "Type"

Throughout this text, I use the word "type" to refer to where on the body a
piece of armor fits, e.g. Head, Body, Arm, or Leg, or to a kind of blade, e.g.
Dagger, Sword, etc.  This is different from the way the word "type" is used in
the game to refer to blunt, edged, or piercing attacks.

3.2. Tables

There are two main kinds of tables used in this text.  The first kind, called a
Combination Table, is used to determine exactly what armor, shield, or blade
will result from a combination.  The results depend only on the specific items
involved; they are independent of the items' materials.  For example, no
distinction needs to be made between a Bronze Rapier and a Hagane Rapier.

The second kind, called a Material Table, is used to determine the material of
an item resulting from a combination.  These tables depend only on the types and
materials of the component items.  For example, no distinction is made between a
Hagane Rapier and a Hagane Khora; both are made of Hagane, and both are one-
handed swords.

By using both a Combination Table and the matching Material Table, the reader
will be able to predict exactly what will result from any possible combination
of items.  This is the same method used by the game, except now you don't have
to be in actual possession of an item to see what can be made from it.

The Combination tables have changed drastically from the way I had them before.
Instead of matrices, they're now enormous lists.  The first column is what goes
in the first combination slot.  The second column is what goes in the second
combination slot.  The third column is what the combination will produce.  The
fourth column is used if changing the order in which the components are combined
produces something different; this eliminates a LOT of redundant entries.

The Material tables are the same as they were before.  The top line of a table
indicates what item goes in the first slot of a combination.  The left column of
the table indicates what item goes in the second slot.  The intersection of row
and column indicate what will result from the combination.

Table entries preceded by "+" or "-" or "*" have some notable property.

+  The combination results in an item of higher level or higher quality material
  than both of the component pieces.

-  The combination results in an item of lower level or lower quality material
  than both of the component pieces.

*  Reversing the order of the combination produces different results (Material
  tables only)

The combination and material tables were created to make it as easy as possible
to import them into a spreadsheet or something.  All the columns in the multi-
part tables are the same width.

================================
4.   Armor
================================

4.1. Armor Combination Tables

The tables in this section are used to determine what piece of armor will result
from a combination.  The first column of each table is what goes in the first
combination slot. The second column is what goes in the second combination slot.
The third column is what the combination produces.  If there is an entry in the
fourth column, that is what the combination would produce if the first
slot/second slot contents are swapped.  If there is no entry in the fourth
column, changing the order of the combination makes no difference.

4.2. Armor Material Table

In a combination of armors, the material of the resulting piece depends only on
the types of armor being combined and their materials.  It is independent of
their relative strengths or levels or anything else.  For example, combining a
piece of Hagane leg armor with a Damascus Helm always resulted in something made
of Hagane.  Whether the resulting piece was for leg, head or arm, however,
depended on what exactly the components were.

The table below is used to determine the material of a piece of armor resulting
from a combination.  The row across the top is the type and material of the
armor in the first combination slot.  The column down the left is the type and
material of the armor in the second slot.  The intersection of row and column
indicates what material the resulting piece of armor will be.  For example,
putting a Leather helm in the first slot and a piece of Iron body armor in the
second results in a piece of Bronze armor.

5.1. Shield Combination Table

The tables in this section are used to determine what shield will result from a
combination.  The first column of each table is what goes in the first
combination slot. The second column is what goes in the second combination slot.
The third column is what the combination produces.  If there is an entry in the
fourth column, that is what the combination would produce if the first
slot/second slot contents are swapped.  If there is no entry in the fourth
column, changing the order of the combination makes no difference.

5.2. Shield Material Table

In a combination of shields, the material of resulting shield depends only on
the material of each shield being combined.

The table below is used to determine the material of a shield resulting from a
combination.  The top row is the material of the shield put into the first
combination slot.  The left column is the material of the shield put into the
second slot.  The intersection of row and column indicates the material of the
shield resulting from the combination.

6.1. Blade Combination Tables

Hwoof.  With ninety different blades that can be combined in 8100 possible ways,
this section is a whopper, but it's one I know will be appreciated by players.
Brace for impact.

The tables in this section are used to determine what blade will result from a
combination.  The first column of each table is what goes in the first
combination slot. The second column is what goes in the second combination slot.
The third column is what the combination produces.  If there is an entry in the
fourth column, that is what the combination would produce if the first
slot/second slot contents are swapped.  If there is no entry in the fourth
column, changing the order of the combination makes no difference.

6.2. Blade Material Table

In a combination of blades, the material of the resulting blade depends only on
the types of blades being combined and their materials.

The tables in this section are used to determine the material of a blade
resulting from a combination.  The top row is the type and material of the blade
put into the first combination slot.  The left column is the type and material
of the blade put into the second slot.  The intersection of row and column
indicates the material of the blade resulting from the combination.

7.   Combination Notes
================================
7.1. Armor Combination

7.1.1.    Armor Levels

The concept of a "pegging" system of armor mentioned in Zy Nicholson's
walkthrough is extremely useful when looking at cross-type armor combination.
In short, there are sixteen different levels of armor.  For each type of armor
(head, body, leg, arm) there is one piece of armor for each of these levels.

7.1.2.    Type A + Type B = Type A or Type B

When combining different types of armor, the relative level of each piece
determines what type will result.  If the levels are different, the result will
be of the same type as the higher-level piece.

For example, if you wanted to combine a Jambeau (Level 10 Leg armor) with a
Segmentata (Level 9 Body armor), you can know without looking at the combination
tables that you will get a piece of leg armor.  In this case, the exact result
would be a Fusskampf.

Extending the example, if you substitute Plate Mail (Level 12 Body) for that
Segmentata, you know that combining it with the Jambeau will give you a piece of
body armor.  In this case, the exact result would be a Brigandine.

Note that when performing cross-type combinations like this, you get better
results from combining a high-level piece with a low-level piece than you get
from combining a high-level piece with a mid-level piece.  If you're tempering
that Jambeau, doing it with a leather piece from level 1 is better than doing it
with something from level 6 or 7.  More reasons for using leather items in
combinations are explained in the Armor Metallurgy section below.

7.1.3.    Type A + Type B = Type C

Things get screwy when you combine different armor types that are of the same
level.  The resulting piece is of a type different from either of the two
components, but of the same level.

Further extending the example above, if we combine the Jambeau with Scale Armor
(Level 10 Body), we get armor not for leg or body, but for arm.  Specifically,
we get a Rondanche (Level 10 Arm).

Table 7.1 can be used to determine what type of armor you would get if you
combined two different types that are of the same level.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Table 7.1:  Combining Different Types of Armor of the Same Level
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
       Head Body Leg  Arm
       ---- ---- ---- ----
Head |      Leg  Arm  Body
Body | Leg       Arm  Head
Leg  | Arm  Arm       Head
Arm  | Body Head Head

There are exceptions.  The first three or four levels of armor don't obey this
rule at all.  That's not of much consequence anyway.  Those items are more
useful because they are made of leather.  More on that in the Armor Metallurgy
section.

7.1.4.    Level Upgrading

Armor can only be upgraded through the levels by combining two of the same type,
i.e. head and head, or body and body.  Combinations yielding armor better than
either component are indicated by a "+" in the tables in section 4.  Zy
Nicholson's walkthrough concisely lists the advantageous armor combinations, as
well as for weapons and shields.

7.1.5.    Armor Materials in Combinations

Combining a leather or bronze piece of with an iron piece of the same type
results in a Hagane piece.  This is usually the first thing a player does to
increase chances of survival.

There are few opportunities to upgrade armor material beyond Hagane.  These are
given in Table 7.2 below.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Leather helm    Hagane arm     Silver
                               helm, arm, or body
Hagane arm      Leather helm   Silver
                               arm, helm, or body

Hagane leg      Silver leg     Damascus
                               leg

Notice that Leather is part of four of the six armor material upgrade paths
listed above, and all the ones that lead to Damascus involve Silver.  Leather
armor only exists on the first three or four levels.  What this means is that to
upgrade the material of that complete Hagane Dread suit you worked so hard to
make, you will have to knock it down to around the Plate Mail level to get
Silver, and down a few more notches if you want something made of Damascus.  A
more sensible approach to armor-building might be to keep all the Leather you
find, bash it into some low-level Silver or Damascus, then use the resulting
pieces to build up through the levels.

When combining different types of armor, the material of one type will dominate
the combination.  For example, when you combine leg armor with arm, head or body
armor, the resulting piece will most likely be of the same material as the leg
armor.  Throw a piece of Hagane leg armor into a combination, and no matter what
the other piece is you're almost assured of getting something made of Hagane.
1.  The material of leg armor will dominate a combination with arm, head,
    or body armor.
2.  The material of arm armor will dominate a combination with head or
    body armor.
3.  The material of body armor will dominate a combination with head armor.
4.  The material of head armor hardly ever matters when combining with
    other types.
There are, of course, exceptions to these rules.  They're not applicable at all
to leather armor.

Silver footwear is perhaps the most useful kind of armor because of a quirk in
the material combination properties.  Combining it with easily obtained Hagane
footwear makes Damascus footwear, which can be used to convert any other piece
of armor to Damascus.  If you're careful about it, you can jump types and keep
the same armor level.

7.2. Shield Combination

There's nothing to say here that can't be easily seen in the tables.

Is it *really* impossible to create a Damascus shield from lower-quality
materials?

7.3. Blade Combination

7.3.1.    Cross-Type Blade Combinations

With careful use of the Blade Combination tables, the player can easily exercise
incredible control in choosing what blades to make.  With a good selection of
blades in inventory, it's almost possible for the player to decide ahead of time
what kind of blade he wants, then find the right sequence of combinations that
will make it.  As other parts of this text echo, don't discard blades perceived
to be junk right away.

7.3.2.    Blade Materials in Combinations

Combining a Bronze blade with an Iron one of the same type results in a Hagane
blade.  You already knew that, didn't you?

There are few opportunities to make Damascus from lower-grade materials.  These
are given in Table 7.3.

                                        Polearm, Crossbow

All of the chances for upgrading blades of lower-quality material to Damascus
require one of the component blades to be Silver.  There is no way to create a
Silver blade by combining lower-grade materials.  They couldn't make this easy
on us, could they?

There are no combinations that will result in a blade made of lower quality
material than either of the components.

As with armor, when combining different types of blades, the material of one
type will dominate the combination.  With few exceptions, the resulting blade
will be of the same material as the dominant blade.  For example, if you combine
a Heavy Mace with *anything* else, the resulting blade will be of the same
material as the Heavy Mace.  The following list gives the order of dominance:
1. Heavy Mace
2. Polearm
3. Great Axe
4. Great Sword
5. Crossbow
6. Axe/Mace
7. Sword
8. Staff
9. Dagger
Unless you hit on one of the fluke combos that spontaneously boosts material
quality, a cross-type blade combination will always result in a blade of the
same material as the type that is higher on the list.

7.4. Special Blades--Holy Win, Hand of Light, Rhomphaia

These special blades are not easy to get.  There's no way to create them from
other blades, and you're sure not going to find one sitting in a chest
somewhere.  They must be won in battle.

These three blades obey some peculiar combination rules.  In almost every case,
the result of combining one of these with a second blade will be the second
blade.  So what's the point?  They're useful for converting material.

7.4.1.    Hand of Light

Hand of Light + [anything besides another heavy mace] = that blade in the same
material as the Hand of Light.

Hand of Light + [another Heavy Mace] = no change in that blade's form; material
is usually Hagane; use the blade material table for an exact prediction.

This rule kind of breaks down when you put the Hand of Light in the first slot
and a polearm or crossbow in the second; you can end up with goofy things like
staves, great axes, or maces.  The Hand of Light can only be found in either
Iron or Hagane, which limits its usefulness as a metal converter.  Creating a
Damascus Hand of Light is impossible.  Check the blade combination and material
tables if you don't believe me.

7.4.2.    Holy Win

Holy Win + [crossbow, axe, mace, sword, staff, or dagger] = that blade in the
same material as the Holy Win.

Holy Win + [heavy mace or polearm] = no change in that blade's form or material.

Holy Win + [another great sword] = no change in that blade's form, material is
usually Hagane; use the blade material table for an exact prediction.

Using a Damascus Holy Win is the preferred method of making a blade into
Damascus.

7.4.3.    Rhomphaia

Rhomphaia + [staff or dagger] = that blade in the same material as the
Rhomphaia.

Rhomphaia +[heavy mace, polearm, great axe, great sword, crossbow, axe/mace] =
no change in that blade's form or material.

Rhomphaia + [another one-handed sword] = no change in that blade's form,
material is usually Hagane; use the blade material table for an exact
prediction.

8.   Analyzing the Game Data Files
================================

This section could also have been called "Where the heck did you get all this
info?"  No, I did not sit down and perform all 359172 possible combinations.  I
looked at the game's own data files.  This whole section describes how all the
tables were created by extracting data from a few files on the game disc.  It is
included so that others may see exactly where the tables came from.  If you
don't care, it's completely skippable.

FWIW, I'm working from the US/NTSC version.  I don't see any reason why other
versions would be different.

\MENU\ARMOR.SYD    Contains the rules for combining armor.
\MENU\BLADE.SYD    Contains the rules for combining blades.
\MENU\SHIELD.SYD   Contains the rules for combining shields.
\MENU\ITEMNAME.BIN Contains the names of all items.
\MENU\ITEMHELP.BIN Contains descriptions of all items.

8.1. Names of Items

Before examining the game data files, I had to generate a list of all the items,
sorted in the same order as the game's internal list.  This would let me decode
the combination tables by associating only a couple hex codes with their
position in the list, then extrapolate what all the other hex codes mean.  If I
had relied on lists within other FAQs, many things would have been incorrect,
since they often put items in an arbitrary order.

This name data is kept in the file \MENU\ITEMNAME.BIN.  I used the Search
Relative program to translate the characters into regular ASCII, then generated
a long list of everything.

As a side note, the extracted list contains a large number of items named as
"untitled."  As if there wasn't enough junk to schlep around, it looks like the
designers were actually holding back.  The file \MENU\ITEMHELP.BIN has
descriptions of all the items.  A lot of the "untitled" ones bear the
description "You don't want to read the description for this item--believe me."
*chuckle*

8.2. Armor Combination Data

The rules governing armor combination are contained in the file \MENU\ARMOR.SYD.
Beginning at offset 000Ch, there are 65 records, each containing 65 characters.

                      Character offset
                      00  01  02  03  04  05  06 ...  3F  40
                     --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
File offset  x000C |  00  00  00  00  00  00  00 ...  00  00
             x004D |  00  11  12  13  14  14  14 ...  4C  4D
             x008E |  00  12  12  13  14  16  17 ...  4C  4D
             x00CF |  00  13  13  13  14  14  14 ...  4C  4D
             x0110 |  00  14  14  14  14  16  16 ...  4C  4D
             x0151 |  00  14  16  14  16  15  17 ...  4B  4C
               ... | ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
             x100B |  00  4C  4C  4C  4C  4B  4A ...  50  4A
             x104C |  00  4D  4D  4D  4D  4C  4B ...  4A  50

The first column and the first row (all 00) are discarded, leaving a 64x64
matrix.  By performing some combinations in the game and comparing the results
with the extracted data, it can be seen that each record represents a particular
piece of armor placed in the first combination slot, and each character offset
within the record represents a particular piece of armor placed in the second
combination slot.  Each actual character within the record represents the result
of the combination.  It can be surmised that the code "11" represents a Bandana,
"12" represents a Bear Mask, and so on up to "50" representing a Dread Glove.

8.3. Armor Material Data

The rules governing what material results when combining armor are contained in
the file \MENU\ARMOR.SYD.  Beginning at offset 1090h, there are 32 records, each
containing 32 characters.

                      Character offset
                      00  01  02  03  04  05  06  07 ...  1E  1F
                     --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
File offset  x1090 |  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00 ...  00  00
             x10B0 |  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00 ...  00  00
             x10D0 |  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00 ...  00  00
             x10F0 |  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00 ...  00  00
             x1110 |  00  00  00  00  01  01  01  01 ...  07  07
             x1130 |  00  00  00  00  01  01  01  01 ...  07  07
             x1150 |  00  00  00  00  01  01  01  01 ...  07  07
             x1170 |  00  00  00  00  01  01  01  01 ...  07  07
               ... | ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
             x1450 |  00  00  00  00  07  07  07  07 ...  07  07
             x1470 |  00  00  00  00  07  07  07  07 ...  07  07

The first four columns and the first four rows (all 00) are discarded, leaving a
28x28 matrix.  As before, we get a feel for how the matrix relates to reality by
comparing the extracted data with some empirical test within the game.  What we
find is that the material of a piece of armor resulting from a combination
depends only on the types and materials of the component pieces.

Each record represents a single type and material of armor placed in the first
combination slot, in the following order:
 1. Wood     Helm
 2. Wood     Body
 3. Wood     Leg
 4. Wood     Arm
 5. Leather  Helm
 6. Leather  Body
 7. Leather  Leg
 8. Leather  Arm
 9. Bronze   Helm
10. Bronze   Body
11. Bronze   Leg
12. Bronze   Arm
13. Iron     Helm
14. Iron     Body
15. Iron     Leg
16. Iron     Arm
17. Hagane   Helm
18. Hagane   Body
19. Hagane   Leg
20. Hagane   Arm
21. Silver   Helm
22. Silver   Body
23. Silver   Leg
24. Silver   Arm
25. Damascus Helm
26. Damascus Body
27. Damascus Leg
28. Damascus Arm
Each character offset within the record represents a single type and material of
armor placed in the second combination slot.  They are in the same order as the
records.  Each actual character within a record represents the material of the
piece resulting from the combination.

Strangely, there is combination data for armor made of wood, even though such
items cannot exist in the game.  This data is simply not used by the game, so I
discarded it.

8.4. Shield Combination Data

The rules governing shields combinations are contained in the file
\MENU\SHIELD.SYD.
Beginning at offset 000Ch, there are 17 records, each containing 17 characters.

                     Character offset
                     00  01  02  03  04 ...  0F  10
                    --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
File Offset x000C |  00  00  00  00  00 ...  00  00
            x001D |  00  01  01  02  01 ...  08  09
            x002E |  00  01  02  04  03 ...  07  08
            x003F |  00  02  04  03  05 ...  06  07
            x0050 |  00  01  03  05  04 ...  05  06
              ... | ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
            x010B |  00  08  07  06  05 ...  10  01
            x011C |  00  09  08  07  06 ...  01  10

The first column and the first row (all 00) are discarded, leaving a 16x16
matrix.  Each record represents a particular shield placed in the first
combination slot, and each character offset within the record represents a
particular shield placed in the second combination slot.  Each actual character
within the record represents the result of the combination.  Figuring out what
shield corresponds with each character is easy.  "01" represents a Buckler, "02"
represents a Pelta Shield, and so on.

8.5. Shield Material Data

The rules governing what material results when combining shields are contained
in the file \MENU\SHIELD.SYD.  Beginning at offset 0130h, there are 8 records,
each containing 8 characters.

                     Character offset
                     00  01  02  03  04  05  06  07
                    --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
File Offset x0130 |  00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00
            x0138 |  00  01  01  03  04  05  06  07
            x0140 |  00  01  03  03  04  05  06  06
            x0148 |  00  03  03  03  05  06  03  05
            x0150 |  00  04  04  05  04  05  04  05
            x0158 |  00  05  05  05  05  05  05  05
            x0160 |  00  06  07  03  04  05  06  06
            x0168 |  00  07  06  05  05  05  06  07

The first row and the first column (all 00) are discarded, leaving a 7x7 matrix.
Each record represents the material of the shield in the first slot.  Each
character offset within a record represents the material of the shield in the
second slot.  Each actual character within a record represents the material of
the shield resulting from the combination.

As with the armor material rules, there is data for combinations involving
leather shields, even though they cannot exist in the game.  I discarded this
data.

8.6. Blade Combination Data

The rules governing blade combination are contained in the file \MENU\BLADE.SYD.
Beginning at offset 000Ch, there are 96 records, each containing 96 characters.

                     Character offset
                     00  01  02  03  04 ...  59  5A  5B  5C  5D  5E  5F

The first column and row, and the last five columns and rows (all 00) are
discarded, leaving a 90x90 matrix.  Each record represents a particular blade
placed in the first combination slot, and each character offset within the
record represents a particular blade placed in the second combination slot.
Each actual character within the record represents the result of the
combination.

8.7. Blade Material Data

The rules governing what material results when combining blades are contained in
the file \MENU\ BLADE.SYD.  Beginning at offset 240Ch, there are 50 records,
each containing 50 characters.

There are five rows and five colums that are all 00, equally space within the
data.  I don't know why these blanks are there.  Perhaps, since entries for
neither wood nor leather are needed for blades, the 00 entries are simply
placeholders.  Whatever their purpose, I am discarding them, leaving a 45x45
matrix.

Each record represents a single type and material of blade placed in the first
combination slot, in the following order:
 1.  Bronze    Dagger
 2.  Bronze    Sword
 3.  Bronze    Great Sword
 4.  Bronze    Axe/Mace
 5.  Bronze    Great Axe
 6.  Bronze    Staff
 7.  Bronze    Heavy Mace
 8.  Bronze    Polearm
 9.  Bronze    Crossbow
10.  Iron      Dagger
11.  Iron      Sword
12.  Iron      Great Sword
13.  Iron      Axe/Mace
14.  Iron      Great Axe
15.  Iron      Staff
16.  Iron      Heavy Mace
17.  Iron      Polearm
18.  Iron      Crossbow
19.  Hagane    Dagger
20.  Hagane    Sword
21.  Hagane    Great Sword
22.  Hagane    Axe/Mace
23.  Hagane    Great Axe
24.  Hagane    Staff
25.  Hagane    Heavy Mace
26.  Hagane    Polearm
27.  Hagane    Crossbow
28.  Silver    Dagger
29.  Silver    Sword
30.  Silver    Great Sword
31.  Silver    Axe/Mace
32.  Silver    Great Axe
33.  Silver    Staff
34.  Silver    Heavy Mace
35.  Silver    Polearm
36.  Silver    Crossbow
37.  Damascus  Dagger
38.  Damascus  Sword
39.  Damascus  Great Sword
40.  Damascus  Axe/Mace
41.  Damascus  Great Axe
42.  Damascus  Staff
43.  Damascus  Heavy Mace
44.  Damascus  Polearm
45.  Damascus  Crossbow
Each character offset within a record represents a single type and material of
blade placed in the second combination slot.  They are in the same order as the
records.  Each actual character within a record represents the material of the
blade resulting from the combination.

Notice that for material combination purposes, the one-handed axes and maces are
considered a single group.

9.   Credits and thanks
================================
Zy Nicholson has written a tremendously useful and entertaining walkthrough.  Go
read it now.  The short list of advantageous combinations made life much easier
for me.

Richard Bush, author of Search Relative.  Darn handy tool.

Everybody on the gamefaqs message board who gave their input on how best to
present the information.  Also everyone on the message board who gives out
useful combinations to anybody who asks.  This information was great for
checking the accuracy of the tables.

================================
10.  Things to do
================================
There's a slight possibility that the tables are transposed.  That is, the first
slot/second slot may be switched.  If I find out that they are, fixing them
would be no problem.

There is more data contained at the end of the files ARMOR.SYD, BLADE.SYD, and
SHIELD.SYD on the game disc.  This data holds some stats for each piece of
equipment.  There's not really a place for it in this document right now, but it
may find its way in later.

================================

I don't care too much where this file is posted, as long as it stays intact and

================================
12.  Contact
================================
It's entirely possible that I've made some mistakes in the tables, or drawn
incorrect conclusions from the data.  Email me to let me know something is wrong
and I'll see what can be done about fixing it.

Please be as specific as possible when reporting mistakes.  "Plastic and clay
make Unobtanium sometimes" is not terribly helpful.  "I combined a plastic
unicycle and a clay gonkulator to make an Unobtanium assault rifle" is better.

Before another person reports this to me, I know there are some sources that say
"Bronze + Hagane = Silver"  That's baloney.  It works for shields, but not for
blades or armor.

13.  Revision History
================================
Version 0.1.  August 3, 2000
Original text.  Not ready for release.

Version 0.2.  August 4, 2000
Completely overhauled the organization.  First come all the tables, then some
notes and general rules on how things work, then all the analysis of the game
data files.  Scrapped the item abbreviations, and just let the tables take up as
much space as they need.  It's still not ready for release.

Version 1.0.  August 8, 2000
Final polish for the first release.

Version 1.1.  August 10, 2000
Converted the matrices to enormously long lists to make printing easier.
